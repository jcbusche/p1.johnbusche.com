	Hi, my name is John. I'm 23 years old and currently taking time off of my undergraduate 
	degree to reconsider my major and general life trajectory.  I'm taking this class because 
	I'm contemplating switching from mechanical engineering to computer science and thought
	it would be a good idea to get my feet wet first.
</p>
<p>
	I'm submitting this late because I also have a part time job at a startup in Cambridge 
	that has kept me very busy the past couple weeks and made it difficult for me to find 
	the time to sit down and go through all of the setup for this project.  This shouldn't happen
	again.
